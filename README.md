# AIEA-Task5-Deontic-Logic-Tutorial
Task 5 for AIEA LAB
Deontic logic is a simple way to write rules about what people must do, may do, or must not do. Think of it as a language for writing down rules and permissions clearly.
The Three Basic Symbols

O means "must" or "obligatory"
P means "may" or "permitted"
F means "must not" or "forbidden"

How to Use Them
Let's use a simple example: Going to school
If s = "go to school", then:

Os means "You must go to school"
Ps means "You may go to school"
Fs means "You must not go to school"

Important Rules

If something is forbidden, it's the same as saying you must not do it:

Fs = O¬s (forbidden = must not)


If something is permitted, it means you're not required to avoid it:

Ps = ¬O¬s (permitted = not required to avoid)



Real-Life Example
Let's write rules for a swimming pool:

Let w = "wear swimsuit"
Let r = "run"

Common pool rules would be:

Ow: "Must wear swimsuit"
Fr: "Must not run"

Practice Example
Try writing this rule: "Students must do their homework"

Let h = "do homework"
Answer: Oh
