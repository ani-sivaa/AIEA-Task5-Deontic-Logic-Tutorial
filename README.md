# AIEA-Task5-Deontic-Logic-Tutorial  

Deontic logic is a simple way to write rules about what people must do, may do, or must not do. Think of it as a language for writing down rules and permissions clearly.

## The Three Basic Symbols  

1. **O**: "Must" or "Obligatory"  
2. **P**: "May" or "Permitted"  
3. **F**: "Must Not" or "Forbidden"

## How to Use Them  

### Example: Going to School  
If `s = "go to school"`, then:  
- `Os` means: "You must go to school"  
- `Ps` means: "You may go to school"  
- `Fs` means: "You must not go to school"  

---

## Important Rules  

1. **Forbidden = Must Not**  
   If something is forbidden, it's the same as saying you must not do it:  
   - `Fs = O¬s`  

2. **Permitted = Not Required to Avoid**  
   If something is permitted, it means you're not required to avoid it:  
   - `Ps = ¬O¬s`

## Real-Life Example  

### Rules for a Swimming Pool  

Let:  
- `w = "wear swimsuit"`  
- `r = "run"`  

Then, common pool rules are:  
- `Ow`: "Must wear swimsuit"  
- `Fr`: "Must not run"

## Practice Example  

**Question:** Write this rule: "Students must do their homework."  
- Let `h = "do homework"`  
- **Answer:** `Oh`

This tutorial provides a structured way to understand and write rules using deontic logic. Experiment with creating your own rules to practice!
